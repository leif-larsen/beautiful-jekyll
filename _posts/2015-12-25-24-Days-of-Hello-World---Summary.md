Over the past 24 days, I have posted a new post daily, with a new programming language each day. Each post have told a bit about some key features of each language, a bit on the history, typical uses and an example of how to use the language. For me it has been an interesting series, and I have learnt quite a bit.

During this series, I have covered the following languages:

4. [C#](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-c)
5. [Java](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-hello-world-java)
6. [Ruby](http://blogleiflarsen.org/24-days-hello-world-ruby)
7. [Erlang](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-erlang)
8. [Perl](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-perl)
9. [F#](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-f)
10. [Node.JS](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-node-js)
11. [Haskell](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-hello-world-haskell)
12. [R](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-r)
13. [PHP](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-php)
14. [Clojure](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-hello-world-clojure)
15. [Pascal](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-pascal)
16. [Lisp](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-lisp)
17. [C++](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-c-2)
18. [Swift](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-swift)
19. [C](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-c-3)
20. [Objective C](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-objective-c)
21. [Cobra](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-cobra)
22. [COBOL](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-cobol)
23. [Ada](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-ada)
24. [Visual Basic](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-visual-basic)
25. [Rust](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-rust)
26. [Go](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-of-hello-world-go)
27. [Python](http://blog.leiflarsen.org/24-days-hello-world-python)

As you can see it has been a lot of work writing about all of these languages, but a lot of fun as well. Naturally I have met challenges during the writing. One of the harder ones was to work with some of the older languages, such as Ada and COBOL. Both of these turned out to give me quite a bit of trouble when writing the example, as I had a hard time getting the compilers work with Windows. Another challenge I was facing was to choose which languages to write about. Before I started I had created a list of languages I wanted to feature, but as I discovered during the work, several of the ones I had chosen, came from the same family, and had so many similarities that I had to drop one of them. A third challenge was to keep the posts short. As you may imagine, some of these languages have a huge history, and in general there is a lot to write about regarding all languages, but to write all would take too much time, and would probably be boring to read.

I haven’t just met challenges though. For me it has been a great experience to learn about all these languages, and see how different languages have developed over time. As a developer I think it is important to at least know of other languages, and how they compare to what you would usually use, so that you can choose the right language for the right project. Some of these languages I had barely heard of before, so it’s nice to actually get to know them, even if it’s on a very high level.

As an addition to this series, I have created a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/leif-larsen/24-Days-of-Hello-World), containing all the code samples from the series (well, at least that is the intention, the files will be committed within a few days). Do take a look at it if you want.

And with that I’ll end this post, and thank you for following along this “advent calendar” this year. Hope you have enjoyed it, and if you do have any ideas on what I can do next year, feel free to tell me!
