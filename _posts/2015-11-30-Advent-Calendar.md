This year I have decided to create my own advent calendar on the blog. I see this an opportunity to explore some new programming languages, and as such my advent calendar will be called “24 days of Hello World”. I will post a simple “Hello World” in a new language every day.

In addition to some code example, I will write a bit on the compilers, some advantages and disadvantages, and also typical uses of the particular language. I will not name any of the languages now, as that will take away some of the surprise.

Tune in from tomorrow, for the first day of advent!
