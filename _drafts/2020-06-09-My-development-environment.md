Starting a new job means setting up a new computer. This time around, I decided to spend some time to really get the environment that I want, so that my development experience is as smooth as possible. I thought I'd take some time to walk through my setup, so that I have some future reference for upgrading my computer, and also to act as inspiration to you.

## The tech specs

The computer I have purchased is a Dell XPS 15 7590, with custom configuration.

It's a powerful computer, powered by an Intel Core i7-9750H CPU, with 6 cores. It comes with 32 GB RAM. To make sure storage is quick, it's equipped with a 1 TB SSD drive. It's got a NVidia GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card, with 4K resolution. To sum it up, I'd say I'm well equipped for a few years of development.
